# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and other relevant factors.

Here's what we've done:

Understanding the Data: We examined various health factors such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure to understand their connection to diabetes risk.

Data Preparation: We cleaned and prepared the data, ensuring it's reliable and ready for analysis.

Data Splitting: We divided the data into two parts: one for training the model and the other for testing its performance.

Model Training: We trained the model using different techniques, including Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees, to find the best approach for predicting diabetes.

Model Evaluation: We assessed the accuracy of our model in predicting diabetes by comparing its predictions with actual outcomes.
